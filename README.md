### Hi there, I'm Becky! 💁🏼‍♀️

I'm currently on an intensive 12-week course with Nology to become a junior full-stack developer. 
When I'm not coding and becoming a general tech girlboss #womeninstem I am...

*🧶 Crocheting something warm 
🚶🏼‍♀️ Walking somewhere pretty
🐈‍⬛ Cuddling my cat
☕ Drinking a giant cup of tea
🏘️ Designing houses on The Sims
🎥 Watching tv shows on repeat

My strengths are:
- Beautifully designed and executed websites in line with BEM and structural standards
- Planned, well-thought out projects using Notion and Exalidraw 
- Can-do attitude to learning new languages and facing challenges

Take a look at my work! 😊
